# Object-Detection-YOLO

A few years ago, the creation of the software and hardware image processing systems was mainly
limited to the development of the user interface, which most of the programmers of each firm were
engaged in. The situation has been significantly changed with the advent of the Windows operating
system when the majority of the developers switched to solving the problems of image processing
itself. 

However, this has not yet led to the cardinal progress in solving typical tasks of recognizing
faces, car numbers, road signs, analyzing remote and medical images, etc. Each of these "eternal" 
problems is solved by trial and error by the efforts of numerous groups of the engineers and scientists. 
As modern technical solutions are turn out to be excessively expensive, the task of automating the
creation of the software tools for solving intellectual problems is formulated and intensively solved
abroad. In the field of image processing, the required tool kit should be supporting the analysis and
recognition of images of previously unknown content and ensure the effective development of
applications by ordinary programmers. Just as the Windows toolkit supports the creation of interfaces
for solving various applied problems. 

Object recognition is to describe a collection of related computer vision tasks that involve activities
like identifying objects in digital photographs. Image classification involves activities such as
predicting the class of one object in an image. Object localization is refers to identifying the location
of one or more objects in an image and drawing an abounding box around their extent. Object
detection does the work of combines these two tasks and localizes and classifies one or more objects
in an image. When a user or practitioner refers to the term “object recognition“, they often mean
“object detection“. It may be challenging for beginners to distinguish between different related
computer vision tasks.
