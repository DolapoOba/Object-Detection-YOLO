# Object-Detection-YOLO



Object detection is the process of finding real world instances like car, bike, TV, flowers, and human beings in digital objects from images or videos. It allows for recognition, localization and detection of multiple objects within an image which provides us with a much better understanding of an image as a whole. Object detection is widely used and has a strong practical value and research prospects. One of its real-time applications is pedestrian detection, industry quality check, self driving cars and security to find all the objects of interest and determine the category and location of the objects. 


For locating objects in the image we use You Only Look Once (YO-LO) approach. Object Localization and have to locate more than one object in real-time systems. There are various techniques for object detection, which can be split into two categories, first is the algorithms based on Classifications. In this, we have to select the interested regions from the image and have to classify them using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). This method is very slow because we have to run a prediction for every selected region. The second category is the algorithms based on Regressions. YOLO method comes under this category. The Objective is detection of objects using You Only Look Once (YOLO) approach. 


In other algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network, the algorithm will not look at the image completely but in YOLO the algorithm looks the image completely by predicting the bounding boxes using convolutional network and the class probabilities for these boxes and detects the image faster as compared to other algorithms.
